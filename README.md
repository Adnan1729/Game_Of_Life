# Game_Of_Life

**Introduction**

John Horton Conway, a British mathematician, created the cellular automaton known as The Game of Life, or just Life, in 1970. [1] It is a zero-player game, which means that its evolution depends only on its starting condition and requires no additional input. The Game of Life can be played by setting up an initial configuration and then watching it develop. It can imitate a universal function Object or any other Turing machine because it is Turing complete.

**Rules**

The world of The Game of Life consists of an unlimited, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which can exist in one of two states: alive or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Each cell interacts with its eight horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbours. At each interval, the following transitions take place:

(1) Any living cell that has less than two living neighbours perishes, as though due to underpopulation.
(2) Any living cell with two or three living neighbours reproduces.
(3) Any living cell with more than three living neighbours perishes as though due to overpopulation.
(4) Any dead cell with exactly three living neighbours transforms into a living cell as though via reproduction.

These rules can be summed up as follows:

(1) Any living cell with at least two or three living neighbours is viable.
(2) Any dead cell surrounded by three living cells becomes alive.
(3) In the following generation, all other living cells perish. Similarly, all other deceased cells remain inactive.

The original pattern serves as the basis for the system. The first generation is generated by simultaneously applying the aforementioned criteria to every cell in the seed, whether it is alive or dead; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and this distinct moment is frequently referred to as a tick. Each generation is an exact function of the one that came before it. The guidelines are regularly applied to produce subsequent generations.
